This project was built on Python 3.9 in a Windows environment, but I have no doubts it will work under different interpreter versions too.
Adjust the requirements.txt versions to the ones that suit your environment, as I don't think I am making use of particular functions available only in recent (ie: non-ancient) versions.

Library d365api.py is from an old script I shamefully copied from an existing open source project I do not have track of anymore.
No matter how long I looked for it on GitHub (I am fairly sure it was here) I cannot find it anymore.
If you are the author, please let me know so I can properly credit you (or refactor it if you won't allow its usage!).

Please copy config.sample.yaml to config.yaml and set it as your own environment connection keys require. All the rest should be self explanatory.
