This project was built on Python 3.9 in a Windows environment, but I have no doubts it will work under different interpreter versions too.
Adjust the requirements.txt versions to the ones that suit your environment, as I don't think I am making use of particular functions available only in recent (ie: non-ancient) versions.

Library d365api.py is from a script I shamefully copied from https://github.com/GearPlug/dynamics365crm-python and adapted to my needs. I am inheriting the MIT license from that component.

Please copy config.sample.yaml to config.yaml and set it as your own environment connection keys require. All the rest should be self explanatory.
